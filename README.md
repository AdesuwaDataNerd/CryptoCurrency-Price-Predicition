# CryptoCurrency-Price-Predicition-with-AutoTS

This project leverages the AutoTS library to predict cryptocurrency prices. AutoTS is an automated time series forecasting library that streamlines the process of model selection and hyperparameter tuning. By employing AutoTS, this project aims to provide an efficient and accurate solution for predicting the future prices of cryptocurrencies specifically bitcoin.

## Key Features
- Utilizes AutoTS for automated time series forecasting.
- Predicts cryptocurrency prices based on historical data.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for training models and making predictions.

## Introduction

Cryptocurrency price prediction is a challenging task that involves analyzing historical price trends to forecast future movements. This project focuses on automating the time series forecasting process using the AutoTS library. AutoTS eliminates the need for manual model selection and hyperparameter tuning by intelligently exploring various time series models and configurations.

### Why AutoTS?

The choice of AutoTS is motivated by its ability to handle the complexity of time series forecasting effortlessly. By automating the model selection and hyperparameter tuning processes, AutoTS allows us to focus on interpreting the results and refining our approach rather than spending time on manual configuration.

### Goals

- Utilize AutoTS to build an accurate and efficient cryptocurrency price prediction model.
- Showcase the ease of use and advantages of automated time series forecasting.
- Provide a foundation for further experimentation and improvements in the cryptocurrency prediction domain.
